  </ul>

  <pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log("Hello, Klutr!");</code></pre>

## Search Functionality and Tagging

Quickly find documents with full-text search and tags. Add tags like `api`, `guide`, or `v1.0` during editing.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Search Bar] --> B[Full-Text Match]
    A --> C[Tag Filter]
    C --> D[api]
    C --> E[guide]
    B --> F[Results List]
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

Organize large projects by applying multiple tags per page. Combine with search for precise results.
